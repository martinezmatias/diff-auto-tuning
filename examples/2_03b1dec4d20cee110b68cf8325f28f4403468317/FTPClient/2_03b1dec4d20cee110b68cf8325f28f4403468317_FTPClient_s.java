 /***
  * FTPClient encapsulates all the functionality necessary to store and
  * retrieve files from an FTP server.  This class takes care of all
  * low level details of interacting with an FTP server and provides
  * a convenient higher level interface.  As with all classes derived
  * from {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient},
  * you must first connect to the server with
  * {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient#connect  connect }
  * before doing anything, and finally
  * {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient#disconnect  disconnect }
  * after you're completely finished interacting with the server.
  * Then you need to check the FTP reply code to see if the connection
  * was successful.  For example:
  * <pre>
  *    boolean error = false;
  *    try {
  *      int reply;
  *      ftp.connect("ftp.foobar.com");
  *      System.out.println("Connected to " + server + ".");
  *      System.out.print(ftp.getReplyString());
  *
  *      // After connection attempt, you should check the reply code to verify
  *      // success.
  *      reply = ftp.getReplyCode();
  *
  *      if(!FTPReply.isPositiveCompletion(reply)) {
  *        ftp.disconnect();
  *        System.err.println("FTP server refused connection.");
  *        System.exit(1);
  *      }
  *      ... // transfer files
  *      ftp.logout();
  *    } catch(IOException e) {
  *      error = true;
  *      e.printStackTrace();
  *    } finally {
  *      if(ftp.isConnected()) {
  *        try {
  *          ftp.disconnect();
  *        } catch(IOException ioe) {
  *          // do nothing
  *        }
  *      }
  *      System.exit(error ? 1 : 0);
  *    }
  * </pre>
  * <p>
  * Immediately after connecting is the only real time you need to check the
  * reply code (because connect is of type void).  The convention for all the
  * FTP command methods in FTPClient is such that they either return a
  * boolean value or some other value.
  * The boolean methods return true on a successful completion reply from
  * the FTP server and false on a reply resulting in an error condition or
  * failure.  The methods returning a value other than boolean return a value
  * containing the higher level data produced by the FTP command, or null if a
  * reply resulted in an error condition or failure.  If you want to access
  * the exact FTP reply code causing a success or failure, you must call
  * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTP#getReplyCode  getReplyCode } after
  * a success or failure.
  * <p>
  * The default settings for FTPClient are for it to use
  * <code> FTP.ASCII_FILE_TYPE </code>,
  * <code> FTP.NON_PRINT_TEXT_FORMAT </code>,
  * <code> FTP.STREAM_TRANSFER_MODE </code>, and
  * <code> FTP.FILE_STRUCTURE </code>.  The only file types directly supported
  * are <code> FTP.ASCII_FILE_TYPE </code> and
  * <code> FTP.BINARY_FILE_TYPE </code>.  Because there are at least 4
  * different EBCDIC encodings, we have opted not to provide direct support
  * for EBCDIC.  To transfer EBCDIC and other unsupported file types you
  * must create your own filter InputStreams and OutputStreams and wrap
  * them around the streams returned or required by the FTPClient methods.
  * FTPClient uses the {@link ToNetASCIIOutputStream NetASCII}  
  * filter streams to provide transparent handling of ASCII files.  We will 
  * consider incorporating EBCDIC support if there is enough demand.
  * <p>
  * <code> FTP.NON_PRINT_TEXT_FORMAT </code>,
  * <code> FTP.STREAM_TRANSFER_MODE </code>, and
  * <code> FTP.FILE_STRUCTURE </code> are the only supported formats,
  * transfer modes, and file structures.
  * <p>
  * Because the handling of sockets on different platforms can differ
  * significantly, the FTPClient automatically issues a new PORT command
  * prior to every transfer requiring that the server connect to the client's
  * data port.  This ensures identical problem-free behavior on Windows, Unix,
  * and Macintosh platforms.  Additionally, it relieves programmers from
  * having to issue the PORT command themselves and dealing with platform
  * dependent issues.
  * <p>
  * Additionally, for security purposes, all data connections to the
  * client are verified to ensure that they originated from the intended
  * party (host and port).  If a data connection is initiated by an unexpected
  * party, the command will close the socket and throw an IOException.  You
  * may disable this behavior with
  * {@link #setRemoteVerificationEnabled setRemoteVerificationEnabled()}.
  * <p>
  * You should keep in mind that the FTP server may choose to prematurely
  * close a connection if the client has been idle for longer than a
  * given time period (usually 900 seconds).  The FTPClient class will detect a
  * premature FTP server connection closing when it receives a
  * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPReply#SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE FTPReply.SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE }
  *  response to a command.
  * When that occurs, the FTP class method encountering that reply will throw
  * an {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPConnectionClosedException}
  * .
  * <code>FTPConnectionClosedException</code>
  * is a subclass of <code> IOException </code> and therefore need not be
  * caught separately, but if you are going to catch it separately, its
  * catch block must appear before the more general <code> IOException </code>
  * catch block.  When you encounter an
  * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTPConnectionClosedException}
  * , you must disconnect the connection with
  * {@link #disconnect  disconnect() } to properly clean up the
  * system resources used by FTPClient.  Before disconnecting, you may check the
  * last reply code and text with
  * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTP#getReplyCode  getReplyCode },
  * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTP#getReplyString  getReplyString },
  * and
  * {@link org.apache.commons.net.ftp.FTP#getReplyStrings  getReplyStrings}.
  * You may avoid server disconnections while the client is idle by
 * periodicaly sending NOOP commands to the server.
  * <p>
  * Rather than list it separately for each method, we mention here that
  * every method communicating with the server and throwing an IOException
  * can also throw a
  * {@link org.apache.commons.net.MalformedServerReplyException}
  * , which is a subclass
  * of IOException.  A MalformedServerReplyException will be thrown when
  * the reply received from the server deviates enough from the protocol
  * specification that it cannot be interpreted in a useful manner despite
  * attempts to be as lenient as possible.
  * <p>
  * Listing API Examples
  * Both paged and unpaged examples of directory listings are available,
  * as follows:
  * <p>
  * Unpaged (whole list) access, using a parser accessible by auto-detect:
  * <pre>
  *    FTPClient f=FTPClient();
  *    f.connect(server);
  *    f.login(username, password);
  *    FTPFile[] files = listFiles(directory);
  * </pre>
  * <p>
  * Paged access, using a parser not accessible by auto-detect.  The class
  * defined in the first parameter of initateListParsing should be derived
  * from org.apache.commons.net.FTPFileEntryParser:
  * <pre>
  *    FTPClient f=FTPClient();
  *    f.connect(server);
  *    f.login(username, password);
  *    FTPListParseEngine engine =
  *       f.initiateListParsing("com.whatever.YourOwnParser", directory);
  *
  *    while (engine.hasNext()) {
  *       FTPFile[] files = engine.getNext(25);  // "page size" you want
  *       //do whatever you want with these files, display them, etc.
  *       //expensive FTPFile objects not created until needed.
  *    }
  * </pre>
  * <p>
  * Paged access, using a parser accessible by auto-detect:
  * <pre>
  *    FTPClient f=FTPClient();
  *    f.connect(server);
  *    f.login(username, password);
  *    FTPListParseEngine engine = f.initiateListParsing(directory);
  *
  *    while (engine.hasNext()) {
  *       FTPFile[] files = engine.getNext(25);  // "page size" you want
  *       //do whatever you want with these files, display them, etc.
  *       //expensive FTPFile objects not created until needed.
  *    }
  * </pre>
  * <p>
  * For examples of using FTPClient on servers whose directory listings 
  * <ul> 
  * <li>use languages other than English</li>
  * <li>use date formats other than the American English "standard" <code>MM d yyyy</code></li>
  * <li>are in different timezones and you need accurate timestamps for dependency checking 
  *     as in Ant</li>
  * </ul>see {@link  FTPClientConfig  FTPClientConfig}.
